# Phone-Holder
This is something my friend has been wanting. its for holding the phone still while he is making stop motion animations. it uses a c clamp to hold itself onto the table with a jaw sixe 0f 80 mm.  here is what it should look like when fully put together. I would advide when you put this on a table to just use the clamp first <img width="1919" height="1079" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 200008" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c00e623-bf5a-4bcd-8a4a-8007a03237dd" /> and then screw in the phone part. 

# here are all of the parts seprately
## This is where the phone will go for now

## And this is the screw and screw cap 

to install the the cap either carefully push it onto the ball of the screw after you put the screw through or heat it a little with a heatgun then push it on
