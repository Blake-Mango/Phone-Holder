# Phone-Holder
This is something my friend has been wanting. its for holding the phone still while he is making stop motion animations. it uses a c clamp to hold itself onto the table with a jaw sixe 0f 80 mm.  here is what it should look like when fully put together. I would advide when you put this on a table to just use the clamp first <img width="1919" height="1079" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 200008" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c00e623-bf5a-4bcd-8a4a-8007a03237dd" /> and then screw in the phone part.
